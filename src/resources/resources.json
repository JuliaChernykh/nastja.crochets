This means I create crochet designs and write tutorials on how to make them. My goal is to make slow fashion more popular and teach others how to create their own clothes!", "I want to create patterns that are accessible to anyone, which is why all my patterns are made to measure. You can easily adjust the pattern to your own size, making it bigger or smaller. For this reason, I always test my tutorials before releasing them!"],
